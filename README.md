Fork the repo and clone it to your local system, navigate to the root of the project and run:

`$ npm install`

This will install the required packages and initialize the project.

`$ node app.js`

This will run the app at port 3000, visit `localhost:3000` to check if it works or not.

Note: Keep the mongod process running, or it will show errors.
